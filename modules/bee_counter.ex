    Because bees are good
    Counting bees involves summing all of the bees
    Thus when we have 2 bees they are actually like 3 bees
    Usage:
      BeeCounter.sum(2) # 3
      # 3 bees are as good as 6 bees
      BeeCounter.sum(3) # 6

      # When the bees are having a negative outlook
      # we flip their frowns upside down and turn them
      # positive by using abs(bee_count)

      BeeCounter.sum(-3) # 6
